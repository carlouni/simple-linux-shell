This is a simplified version of a Linux shell client. Useful to understand how
the Linux command line is implemented as well as to provide insights on how to implement
a generic shell client for any application written in C.

This can be compiled on Linux Debian and derivatives. Haven't tried to compile it on
other distributions but it is compliant with C standards.

Use it under your own risk. Not responsible for any damage or data loss.

### Building executables on Linux:

    1.- Make sure the system has the 'gcc compiler' and 'make'.
